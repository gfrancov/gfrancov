Hello! My name is Gabriel Franco, but everyone calls me Gabi.

I'm from Badalona, ​and I'm constantly on a mission to improve the digital world by giving it a more human touch.

I am a Systems Administrator and Web Developer, therefore, I'm a technologist.

Digital minimalism, efficiency, comfort and sustainability are the principles that drive me as a computer scientist.
